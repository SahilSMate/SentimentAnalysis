Thus the air circulation dries your hair. And after drying my hair the temperature increases very slightly. I can guarantee it gets more heated if I walk in the sun for say 10mins.My dermatologist asked me to apply my hair serum after the shower, in dry hair. So, previously I had to wait a long time for my hair to dry \"naturally.\" Now it\\'s just mere minutes.I never used high settings of the dryer, as the medium is enough for me. Totally a worthy purchase.Cons: The cool-shot button just decrease the temperature of the air coming out slightly. It\\'s still warm air. But less warm. Forget cool air or normal air.',\n",

Better to avoid. There are many alternatives. It's Indian brad, but sadly importing directly from China.\",\n",
